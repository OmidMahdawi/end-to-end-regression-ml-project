# Bulldozer Price Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end Machine Learning workflow** to predict the **sale price of bulldozers** based on historical auction data.
It is inspired by the **Bluebook for Bulldozers Kaggle Competition**, which provides a dataset containing information about equipment sales, specifications, and usage.

The workflow demonstrates the **full ML pipeline**, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a regression model to predict the sale price of bulldozers.
* Perform feature engineering and preprocessing on raw structured data.
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
* Deploy a reproducible workflow that can be applied to real-world datasets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language**: Python 3.12
* **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* **Libraries**:

  * `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization
  * `scikit-learn` – machine learning models and preprocessing
  * `xgboost` / `randomforest` – advanced ML algorithms
  * `joblib` – model saving and loading

## 🔑 Dataset

The dataset comes from **Kaggle’s Bluebook for Bulldozers Competition**.

* **Train.csv** → Historical sales data for training the model.
* **Valid.csv** → Validation set for model tuning.
* **Test.csv** → Test set for final evaluation.

📊 Features include:

* Product specifications (e.g., `ModelID`, `MachineID`, `YearMade`)
* Usage and sale-related data (e.g., `SaleDate`, `UsageHours`)
* Target variable: **SalePrice**

---

## 📊 Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**

   * Handle missing values
   * Parse dates and categorical variables
   * Feature extraction from timestamps (e.g., year, month)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visualize feature distributions
   * Correlation analysis with target variable

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Encoding categorical variables
   * Handling skewness in numerical features
   * Creating new time-based features

4. **Modeling**

   * Baseline models: Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor
   * Advanced models: XGBoost, Gradient Boosting
   * Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV

5. **Evaluation**

   * Metrics: Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE), MAE, R²
   * Learning curves and feature importance analysis

6. **Model Saving**

   * Save trained model for reuse with `joblib`

---

## 📈 Results

* The **best-performing model** achieved strong predictive performance on the validation dataset using **Random Forest / XGBoost**.
* Feature importance analysis showed that **`YearMade`, `Enclosure`, `SaleYear`, `ProductSize`** were among the most impactful predictors.
